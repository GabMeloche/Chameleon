# Chameleon
An infiltration-style Unity game with texture-changing stealth dynamics (WIP).

This project was developped with the challenge of using as little coroutines as possible. Hence the many, many member variables for AI-related classes.

You are a humanoid chameleon that has just managed to rob one of the most prestigious museums of the world. However, your way back out is has been blocked! You're stuck inside until dawn. Your job is to survive for as long as possible without getting caught by the guards. Security cameras scan many areas and guards patrol the museum, so you have very little room to hide and evade detection. However, you have access to a chameleon's prime survival tactic: blending in to the environment. 

If you stay still for a few seconds, your skin will morph to blend into the surrounding texture. However, your camouflage is only good for a limited amount of time, so simply staying put until the game is over is not an option. Guards will have a much harder time spotting you if your camouflage matches the environment.

The game was conceived to be nearly impossible to finish. The goal is rather to survive for as long as possible, accumulating points for every second survived. Certain museum objects can be stolen for extra points.

Developped over the course of 3 weeks. 

There are 2 game modes: Regular and Easy. When playing Regular mode, once a guard sees you, all of the guards will look for you until you are caught or until the game ends. On Easy mode, If the guards have seen you once but can't find you for a certain amount of time, they give up searching and return to their posts.
